* This app allows the user to display a sorted list of selected stocks. List entries include the stock ```symbol``` (and ```company name```), the ```current price```, the ```daily price change amount``` and ```price percent change```.

* There is no need to use a different layout for landscape orientation in this application as the same layout should work in any orientation.

* Selected stock symbols and the related names should be stored in the device’s ```SQLite Database```.

* A ```Stock``` class should be created to represent each individual stock in the application. Required data includes: ```Stock Symbol``` (String), ```Company Name``` (String), ```Price``` (double), ```Price Change``` (double), and ```Change Percentage``` (double). 

* Clicking on a stock opens a browser displaying the Marketwatch webpage for that stock

* ```Swipe-Refresh``` (pull-down) refreshes stock data.
